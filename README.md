# MCP Registry

A local application that aggregates Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into a searchable directory with reputation scoring.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This repository is a live demo built to showcase the [multi-agent AI development methodology](https://github.com/omrilahav/vibe-coding).  
> While it is a functional product, its primary purpose is to demonstrate how you can use AI agents to build software — and even run entire workflows and teams — through a structured, repeatable prompt-based process.  
>
> The methodology behind this project is detailed in our upcoming blog post (link coming soon). It explores how roles like Product Manager, Architect, Designer, Dev Lead, and Engineers can be executed by AI agents, all collaborating through clear interfaces and shared outputs.
>
> 🗂 To explore the full process and see exactly how the app was built, check out the outputs generated by the different agents in the following directories:  
> `product/`, `architecture/`, `design/`, `tasks/`, and `demo-methodology-files/`.

## Project Overview

MCP Registry serves as a centralized directory for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The system aggregates data from multiple sources, calculates reputation scores, and provides a searchable interface for users to discover and evaluate MCP servers.

## Features

- **Server Discovery**: Find and browse MCP servers from various sources
- **Reputation Scoring**: Evaluate servers based on calculated reputation scores
- **Search & Filter**: Easily search and filter servers based on various criteria
- **Local Database**: All data is stored locally for offline access

## Known Issues

### Glama API Integration

There is a known issue with the Glama API integration for fetching MCP servers:

- The current implementation attempts to fetch data from the Glama.ai API endpoint, but there are connectivity problems with this external service.
- This affects the "Load Latest Servers" functionality on the homepage.
- Future versions will implement additional data sources and more robust error handling for external API dependencies.
- For now, the application works with locally submitted and mock data.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM
- **Application**: Electron for desktop packaging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-registry.git
   cd mcp-registry
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Initialize Prisma
   ```
   npx prisma generate
   ```

### Development

1. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the Electron app and React development server.

2. Build the application
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
