# MCP Registry - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Summary

### Executive Overview
MCP Registry is a web-based application that aggregates publicly available Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into a centralized, searchable directory. Users can discover, evaluate, and monitor MCP servers based on metadata, reputation scores, and community feedback.

### Business Goals
- Create a trusted source for discovering and evaluating MCP servers
- Help developers and researchers make informed decisions about MCP server integration
- Reduce security risks related to tool poisoning and prompt injection attacks
- Establish a community-driven platform for MCP server reputation and feedback

### What This Product Is and Why It Matters
MCP Registry is a discovery platform for Model Context Protocol servers that extends AI capabilities through file access, database connections, API integrations, and other services. As AI tools adoption accelerates, developers need a reliable way to discover quality MCP servers while avoiding security risks. This product matters because:

1. The MCP ecosystem is rapidly expanding (9,800+ tools on Glama.ai alone)
2. No centralized, reputation-based directory currently exists
3. Security concerns like tool poisoning are increasing as AI tools gain popularity
4. Developers lack efficient ways to evaluate MCP server quality and security

## 2. Personas and Target Users

## 3. Problems, Jobs-To-Be-Done, and Value Proposition

### Problems
1. **Discovery Challenge**: MCP servers are scattered across different repositories and directories
2. **Trust Deficit**: No standardized way to evaluate security and reliability
3. **Fragmented Information**: Metadata about servers is inconsistent across sources
4. **Monitoring Overhead**: Difficult to stay updated on server changes and community feedback

### Jobs-To-Be-Done
1. "Help me find relevant MCP servers for my specific AI application needs"
2. "Show me which MCP servers are trustworthy and well-maintained"
3. "Allow me to compare different MCP servers with similar functionality"
4. "Keep me updated on changes to MCP servers I'm using or monitoring"
5. "Let me contribute feedback on servers I've used to help the community"

### Value Proposition
MCP Registry is the first centralized directory that aggregates, evaluates, and scores Model Context Protocol servers, enabling developers to quickly discover trusted tools for AI applications while reducing security risks through community-driven reputation metrics.
