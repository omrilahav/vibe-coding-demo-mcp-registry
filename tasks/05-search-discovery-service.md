# Task 05: Search and Discovery Service Implementation

## Task Context

**What this task does**: Implement the Search and Discovery Service that enables efficient searching, filtering, and browsing of the MCP server registry.

**Why it's important**: The Search and Discovery Service is the core user-facing functionality that allows users to find relevant MCP servers based on their needs. This service must be efficient, accurate, and provide a good user experience.

- [Data Flow](/architecture/data-flow.md)
- [Architecture Overview](/architecture/overview.md)
- [Product Requirements Document](/product/PRD.md)
- [Design - Screens and Flows](/design/screens.md)

## Instructions

Implement the Search and Discovery Service that enables users to search, filter, and browse MCP servers. The service should use SQLite's search capabilities effectively and provide performant, relevant results.

### Deliverables

1. **Search Engine**: Implement a text-based search functionality that:
   - Searches across server names, descriptions, and categories
   - Ranks results by relevance
   - Supports partial word matching
   - Handles common search patterns efficiently

2. **Filter Engine**: Create a filtering system that supports:
   - Category filtering
   - License type filtering
   - Reputation score range filtering
   - Last updated timeframe filtering
   - Combinations of multiple filters

3. **Sort Engine**: Implement sorting capabilities for:
   - Relevance (default for search results)
   - Reputation score (highest first)
   - Recent updates (newest first)
   - Alphabetical order

4. **Query Optimizer**: Ensure database queries are efficient by:
   - Using appropriate indexes
   - Implementing pagination for large result sets
   - Optimizing complex filter combinations
   - Caching frequent queries (optional for MVP)

5. **API Endpoints**: Create Express API endpoints for:
   - Text search
   - Filter application
   - Sorting control
   - Result pagination
   - Server details retrieval

6. **Testing**: Implement tests for:
   - Search accuracy
   - Filter combinations
   - Sort order
   - Query performance
   - Edge cases (empty results, large result sets)

### Implementation Details

#### Text Search Implementation
- Utilize SQLite's FTS5 (Full-Text Search) capability
- Implement tokenization for better matching
- Consider implementing search term highlighting
- Create a relevance ranking algorithm
- Handle special characters and common search operators

#### Filter Implementation
- Design a query builder for converting filter selections to SQL
- Implement efficient SQL for multiple filter combinations
- Handle empty filter values appropriately
- Consider performance optimizations for complex filters

#### Sort Implementation
- Create flexible sorting mechanisms
- Support multiple sort criteria
- Implement default sorting based on context

#### Pagination Implementation
- Set reasonable default page size (20-25 items)
- Implement efficient offset/limit pagination
- Return total count with results
- Include metadata for current page, total pages, etc.

#### Server Details Retrieval
- Implement efficient queries for detailed server information
- Include all related data (reputation scores, categories, etc.)
- Consider eager loading for commonly accessed relations

### API Endpoints

Design and implement the following API endpoints:

1. **Search Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/servers/search?q=<query>&page=<page>&limit=<limit>&sort=<sort>`
   - Supports additional filter parameters

2. **Filter Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/servers?category=<category>&license=<license>&minScore=<score>&lastUpdated=<timeframe>&page=<page>&limit=<limit>&sort=<sort>`

3. **Server Details Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/servers/:id`
   - Returns comprehensive server details

4. **Categories Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/categories`
   - Returns all available categories for filtering

### Implementation Notes

- Optimize query performance with appropriate indexes
- Implement proper error handling for malformed queries
- Add logging for search queries to help with optimization
- Consider implementing a simple caching mechanism for common searches
- Design the API to be consistent and RESTful
- Document all endpoints with clear parameter descriptions
- Consider rate limiting for search endpoints
- Implement security measures to prevent SQL injection
- Test with both small and large datasets
