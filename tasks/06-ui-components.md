# Task 06: UI Components Implementation

## Task Context

**What this task does**: Implement the core reusable UI components for the MCP Registry application based on the design system specifications.

**Why it's important**: These UI components will be the building blocks for all screens in the application. Creating consistent, well-designed components will ensure a cohesive user experience and speed up the development of subsequent screens.

**Related specs**:
- [Design System](/design/system.md)
- [UI Components](/design/components.md)
- [Screens and Flows](/design/screens.md)
- [Notes for Developers](/design/notes-for-devs.md)

## Instructions

Implement the core UI components needed for the MCP Registry application using React, TypeScript, and Material-UI. These components should follow the design system specifications and be well-tested, accessible, and reusable across the application.

### Deliverables

1. **Base Components**: Implement the following basic UI components:
   - Button (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary variants)
   - Text Input
   - Select Dropdown
   - Checkbox
   - Radio Button
   - Search Bar

2. **Navigation Components**: Create the navigation elements:
   - App Header
   - Primary Navigation
   - Breadcrumb Navigation

3. **Data Display Components**: Implement components for displaying server data:
   - Server Card
   - Reputation Badge
   - Category Tag
   - Server Detail Card
   - Feedback Item

4. **Feedback Components**: Create components for user feedback:
   - Toast Notification
   - Loading State
   - Empty State
   - Error State

5. **Layout Components**: Implement layout utility components:
   - Container
   - Card Grid
   - Section Divider
   - Tabs
   - Modal

6. **Storybook Documentation**: Set up Storybook and create stories for each component showing:
   - Different variants and states
   - Usage examples
   - Component props documentation
