# Task 08: Server Directory Implementation

## Task Context

**What this task does**: Implement the Server Directory page that allows users to search, filter, and browse the MCP server registry.

**Why it's important**: The Server Directory is a core feature of the application, enabling users to discover MCP servers that match their specific needs. It must provide efficient search, intuitive filtering, and clear presentation of servers.

**Related specs**:
- [Screens and Flows](/design/screens.md)
- [UI Components](/design/components.md)
- [Design System](/design/system.md)
- [Notes for Developers](/design/notes-for-devs.md)

## Instructions

Implement the Server Directory page according to the design specifications, integrating with the search and discovery service created in Task 05 and utilizing the UI components from Task 06.

### Deliverables

1. **Directory Page Component**: Create the main server directory component with:
   - Header with search bar
   - Filter panel
   - Results area with server cards
   - Pagination controls
   - Sort controls
   - Results count indicator

2. **Filter Panel Implementation**: Create a filter panel with:
   - Categories filter (checkbox list)
   - License type filter (radio buttons)
   - Reputation score filter (slider or presets)
   - Last updated filter (timeframe options)
   - Reset filters button

3. **Search Integration**: Connect the directory to the search service:
   - Implement search submission handling
   - Support URL query parameters for sharing/bookmarking
   - Update results as filters are applied
   - Store search state (for navigation back to results)

4. **Results Display**: Implement the server cards grid with:
   - Responsive layout (1-4 columns depending on screen size)
   - Proper loading states
   - Empty state for no results
   - Error state for API failures
   - Smooth transitions between result sets

5. **Pagination and Sorting**: Implement controls for:
   - Page navigation
   - Results per page selection
   - Sorting by different criteria
   - Persistence of pagination/sort across filter changes

6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the directory layout works on different screen sizes:
   - Desktop layout with side filter panel
   - Tablet layout with collapsible filter panel
   - Mobile layout with modal/drawer filter panel

### Implementation Details

#### Directory Page Structure
- Implement the page layout according to the design specs
- Create state management for search, filters, pagination, and sorting
- Connect to appropriate API endpoints
- Handle URL query parameters for deep linking

#### Filter Panel Implementation
- Create collapsible filter sections
- Implement controlled form components for each filter type
- Handle filter combinations and interactions
- Create clear/reset functionality
- Persist filter state across searches

#### Results Grid Implementation
- Create responsive grid layout for server cards
- Implement proper spacing and alignment
- Handle different screen sizes properly
- Support keyboard navigation between cards

#### Empty and Error States
- Create user-friendly empty state with suggestions
- Implement appropriate error states with retry options
- Handle edge cases like partial data loading

#### Pagination Implementation
- Create accessible pagination controls
- Show current page and total pages
- Implement efficient page navigation
- Handle edge cases (last page, first page)

### API Integration

Integrate with the following API endpoints created in Task 05:

1. **Search Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/servers/search?q=<query>&page=<page>&limit=<limit>&sort=<sort>`
   - Additional filter parameters as needed

2. **Filter Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/servers?category=<category>&license=<license>&minScore=<score>&lastUpdated=<timeframe>&page=<page>&limit=<limit>&sort=<sort>`

3. **Categories Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/categories` - To populate category filters

### URL Structure

Implement a URL structure that encodes search and filter state for bookmarking and sharing:

```
/directory?q=query&category=category1,category2&license=open&minScore=50&lastUpdated=month&page=2&sort=reputation
```

### Implementation Notes

- Use React Router for handling URL parameters
- Implement debounce for filter changes to prevent excessive API calls
- Consider using React Query or similar for data fetching and caching
- Ensure filters are applied client-side first for a responsive feel, then confirmed with server data
- Make the filter panel collapsible/expandable on smaller screens
- Implement keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- Optimize for performance, especially with large result sets
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for very large results (optional for MVP)
- Use proper semantic HTML for better accessibility
- Implement proper focus management for filter interactions
