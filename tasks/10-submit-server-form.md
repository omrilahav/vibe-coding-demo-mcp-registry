# Task 10: Submit Server Form Implementation

## Task Context

**What this task does**: Implement the Submit Server form that allows users to contribute new MCP servers to the registry.

**Why it's important**: User contributions are a key part of growing the MCP Registry. This form enables the community to add new servers, making the registry more comprehensive and valuable to all users.

- [Design System](/design/system.md)
- [Notes for Developers](/design/notes-for-devs.md)
- [Product Requirements Document](/product/PRD.md)

## Instructions

Implement the Submit Server form according to the design specifications, utilizing the UI components created in previous tasks and integrating with backend services to handle user submissions.

### Deliverables

1. **Submit Form Component**: Create the main form component with:
   - Introduction text explaining the submission process
   - Form fields for server information
   - Validation for required fields
   - Submit and Cancel buttons
   - Success and error feedback

2. **Form Fields Implementation**: Create the following form fields:
   - Server Name (text input) *required
   - Server URL/GitHub Repository (text input) *required
   - Description (text area) *required
   - Categories (multi-select dropdown) *required
   - License Type (select dropdown) *required
   - Documentation URL (text input) *optional
   - Additional Notes (text area) *optional

3. **Validation Logic**: Implement form validation for:
   - Required field checking
   - URL format validation
   - Description length requirements
   - Category selection requirements
   - Duplicate server detection (if possible)

4. **Submission Handling**: Create logic to:
   - Format submission data for the API
   - Submit to the backend endpoint
   - Handle success responses
   - Handle error responses
   - Provide appropriate user feedback

5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the form works well on different screen sizes:
   - Desktop layout with appropriate field sizes
   - Tablet layout with adjusted proportions
   - Mobile layout with stacked fields

6. **Form State Management**: Implement proper state handling for:
   - Form values
   - Validation status
   - Submission status
   - Error messages
   - Success confirmation

### Implementation Details

#### Form Layout
- Organize fields in a logical, user-friendly layout
- Group related fields together
- Use proper spacing between fields
- Include clear labels and helper text
- Show validation requirements near relevant fields

#### Form Validation
- Implement client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Show validation errors inline with fields
- Disable submit button until all required fields are valid
- Provide clear error messages that explain requirements
- Validate URLs for correct format

#### Category Selection
- Populate categories from the API
- Allow multiple selection
- Show selected categories clearly
- Provide search/filter functionality for many categories
- Handle required validation appropriately

#### Submission Flow
- Show loading state during submission
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Display clear success message after submission
- Provide option to submit another server or return to homepage
- Clear form after successful submission

#### Error Handling
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Provide guidance on fixing validation issues
- Handle API errors with appropriate feedback
- Preserve form data on failed submissions
- Allow users to retry failed submissions

### API Integration

Integrate with the following API endpoint:

1. **Submit Server Endpoint**
   - `POST /api/servers` - Submit a new server
   - Request format should match the database schema
   - Handle 201 Created responses
   - Handle validation errors (400 Bad Request)
   - Handle duplicate detection (409 Conflict)

2. **Categories Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/categories` - Get available categories for selection

### Implementation Notes

- Use form libraries like Formik or React Hook Form if appropriate
- Implement controlled components for all form fields
- Use the UI components created in previous tasks for consistency
- Consider auto-suggestion for GitHub repositories (optional)
- Implement field-level validation for immediate feedback
- Consider form persistence to prevent data loss on accidental navigation
- Use proper HTML5 input types and attributes for better UX
- Ensure form is fully keyboard accessible
- Test with screen readers for accessibility
- Handle long text input gracefully
- Implement autofocus on first field for better UX
- Consider implementing draft saving for longer forms
