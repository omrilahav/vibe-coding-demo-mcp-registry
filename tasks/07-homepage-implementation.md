# Task 07: Homepage Implementation

## Task Context

**What this task does**: Implement the MCP Registry homepage using the UI components created in the previous task, integrating with the backend services for data display.

**Why it's important**: The homepage is the entry point to the application, providing users with an overview of the MCP Registry and quick access to key features. It needs to make a good first impression and effectively guide users to the main functionality.

- [UI Components](/design/components.md)
- [Design System](/design/system.md)
- [Notes for Developers](/design/notes-for-devs.md)

## Instructions

Implement the MCP Registry homepage according to the design specifications, utilizing the UI components created in the previous task and integrating with backend services to display real data.

### Deliverables

1. **Homepage Component**: Create the main homepage component with sections as specified in the design:
   - Header with navigation and search
   - Hero section with headline and CTA
   - Statistics bar
   - Featured servers section
   - Categories section
   - About section

2. **Data Integration**: Connect the homepage to backend services to display:
   - Statistics (number of servers, categories, contributions)
   - Featured servers (top-rated servers)
   - Categories with counts

3. **Search Integration**: Implement the search functionality on the homepage:
   - Connect the search bar to the search service
   - Handle search queries and navigation to results
   - Implement basic typeahead/autocomplete (optional for MVP)

4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the homepage layout works on different screen sizes:
   - Desktop layout (1024px and above)
   - Tablet layout (640px - 1023px)
   - Mobile layout (up to 639px)

5. **State Management**: Implement proper state management for:
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Data caching (optional for MVP)

6. **Testing**: Create tests for:
   - Component rendering
   - User interactions
   - Responsive behavior
   - Integration with backend services

### Implementation Details

#### Hero Section
- Implement headline and subheadline with compelling copy
- Create primary CTA button that navigates to the server directory
- Add background using specified brand colors/patterns
- Ensure proper responsiveness for different screen sizes

   - Use `/api/servers?sort=reputation&limit=4` for featured servers
   - Get categories from `/api/categories`

2. **Navigation Integration**
   - Link CTA button to server directory
   - Link category tiles to filtered views
   - Connect "View All" to the full directory

3. **Search Integration**
   - Connect search bar to search endpoint
   - Handle search submissions
   - Navigate to search results page with query parameters

### Implementation Notes

- Use React Router for navigation between pages
- Implement proper loading states while data is being fetched
- Create error handling for API failures
- Use responsive design principles (mobile-first approach)
- Follow the design system for colors, typography, spacing, etc.
- Consider implementing basic caching for frequently accessed data
- Ensure accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, screen readers, etc.)
- Optimize component rendering to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use React Query or similar for data fetching and caching (optional)
