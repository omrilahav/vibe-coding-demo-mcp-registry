# Task 12: Documentation Generation

## Task Context

**What this task does**: Create comprehensive documentation for the MCP Registry application, including user guides, API documentation, and technical documentation for developers.

**Why it's important**: Good documentation is essential for both users and developers. It helps users understand how to use the application effectively and allows developers to maintain and extend the codebase.

**Related specs**:
- [Product Requirements Document](/product/PRD.md)
- [Architecture Overview](/architecture/overview.md)
- [Components and Services](/architecture/components.md)
- [Technology Stack](/architecture/stack.md)

## Instructions

   - Authentication details (for future implementation)
   - Error response formats and codes

3. **Developer Documentation**:
   - Project architecture overview
   - Setup and installation guide
   - Code organization and structure
   - Development workflow and best practices
   - Testing approach and guidelines
   - Contribution guidelines

4. **README Files**:
   - Main project README with overview and quick start
   - Component-specific READMEs for key modules
   - Documentation on how to extend the application

5. **Inline Code Documentation**:
   - Review and enhance existing code comments
   - Add JSDoc comments for key functions and components
   - Ensure consistent documentation style throughout
