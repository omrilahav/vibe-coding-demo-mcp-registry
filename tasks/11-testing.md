# Task 11: End-to-End Testing

## Task Context

**What this task does**: Implement end-to-end tests that validate the complete functionality of the MCP Registry application, ensuring all components work together correctly.

**Why it's important**: End-to-end testing ensures that the application works as a cohesive whole from the user's perspective. This task is critical for identifying integration issues that might not be caught by unit or component tests alone.

**Related specs**:
- [Screens and Flows](/design/screens.md)
- [User Stories](/product/PRD.md#user-stories-and-flows)
- [Architecture Overview](/architecture/overview.md)
- [Notes for Developers](/design/notes-for-devs.md)

## Instructions

Create a comprehensive end-to-end testing suite that validates the core user flows and functionality of the MCP Registry application. The tests should cover critical paths through the application and verify that all components work together correctly.

### Deliverables

1. **E2E Testing Setup**: Configure an end-to-end testing environment using:
   - Cypress for browser-based testing
   - Test database setup with sample data
   - Mocked external APIs where necessary
   - CI integration for automated test runs

2. **Core User Flow Tests**: Implement tests for the following flows:
   - Discovery Flow: Homepage → Browse → Filter → Server Detail
   - Search Flow: Search → Results → Server Detail
   - Contribution Flow: Submit Server Form → Validation → Submission
   - Feedback Flow: Server Detail → Submit Feedback

3. **Component Integration Tests**: Create tests that verify:
   - Backend API integration with frontend
   - Data display consistency
   - Navigation and routing
   - State persistence and management

4. **Edge Case Tests**: Implement tests for challenging scenarios:
   - Empty search results handling
   - Form validation and error handling
   - API error responses
   - Slow network conditions
   - Pagination with large data sets

5. **Accessibility Tests**: Include tests for:
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Focus management
   - Color contrast and readability

6. **Test Documentation**: Create documentation for:
   - Test coverage report
   - Instructions for running tests
   - Guidelines for adding new tests
   - Common testing patterns and utilities

### Implementation Details

- Configure Cypress with appropriate plugins and extensions
- Create test utilities for common actions
- Set up database seeding for consistent test data
- Implement mock server for external APIs
- Configure test reports and screenshots

#### Discovery Flow Tests

- Test homepage rendering and navigation
- Verify category browsing and filtering
- Test server card rendering and interaction
- Validate server detail page loading

#### Search Flow Tests

- Test search input and submission
- Verify search results display
- Test search filters application
- Validate sort order functionality
- Test pagination controls

#### Contribution Flow Tests

- Test form field validation
- Verify form submission
- Test error handling for invalid input
- Verify success confirmation

#### Backend Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints with real requests
- Verify data loading and display
- Test data mutations (submissions, feedback)
- Validate error handling for API failures

### Test Scenarios

Implement specific tests for the following scenarios:

1. **Basic Discovery**
   - User visits homepage
   - User browses server categories
   - User selects a category
   - User views filtered results
   - User selects a server
   - User views server details

2. **Search and Filter**
   - User enters search query
   - User views search results
   - User applies multiple filters
   - User sorts results
   - User navigates through pagination
   - User clears filters

3. **Server Submission**
   - User navigates to submission form
   - User attempts to submit with invalid data
   - User views validation errors
   - User corrects input and submits
   - User receives confirmation

4. **Feedback Submission**
   - User views server details
   - User navigates to feedback tab
   - User submits feedback
   - User sees updated feedback list

5. **Error Handling**
   - User searches with no results
   - User encounters API error
   - User submits duplicate server
   - User experiences slow network

### Implementation Notes

- Create reusable test utilities and commands
- Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
- Use descriptive test names and organization
- Consider implementing visual regression testing
- Ensure tests run in a reasonable time
- Implement retry logic for flaky tests
- Use custom Cypress commands for common operations
- Create fixtures for test data
- Document any test-specific requirements
- Consider implementing test data factories
- Set up proper CI pipeline integration
