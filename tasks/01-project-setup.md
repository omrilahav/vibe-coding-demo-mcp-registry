# Task 01: Project Setup and Initial Structure

## Task Context

**What this task does**: Initialize the MCP Registry project with the correct folder structure, dependencies, and configuration files according to the architecture and technology stack specifications.

**Why it's important**: A well-organized project setup establishes the foundation for all future development tasks and ensures consistency across the project.

**Related specs**:
- [Architecture Overview](/architecture/overview.md)
- [Technology Stack](/architecture/stack.md)
- [Infrastructure](/architecture/infra.md)

## Instructions

Set up the MCP Registry project as a local Electron application with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend. This setup will enable the application to run as a desktop app while maintaining a web-like architecture that can be transitioned to a web application in the future.

### Deliverables

1. **Project Structure**: Create the following directory structure:
   ```
   mcp-registry/
   ├── package.json
   ├── tsconfig.json
   ├── .eslintrc.js
   ├── .prettierrc
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── README.md
   ├── src/
   │   ├── main/                  # Electron main process
   │   │   └── index.ts           # Main entry point
   │   ├── renderer/              # Frontend (React)
   │   │   ├── components/        # Reusable UI components
   │   │   ├── pages/             # Page components
   │   │   ├── services/          # Frontend services
   │   │   ├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
   │   │   ├── types/             # TypeScript type definitions
   │   │   ├── utils/             # Utility functions
   │   │   ├── App.tsx            # Main App component
   │   │   └── index.tsx          # Renderer entry point
   │   ├── shared/                # Shared code between main and renderer
   │   │   ├── types/             # Shared type definitions
   │   │   └── constants/         # Shared constants

   │       ├── models/            # Data models
   │       ├── services/          # Backend services
   │       │   ├── collection/    # Data collection service
   │       │   ├── reputation/    # Reputation scoring engine
   │       │   └── search/        # Search service
   │       ├── utils/             # Utility functions
   │       └── index.ts           # Server entry point
   ├── public/                    # Static assets
   └── tests/                     # Test files
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: Set up the following technologies as specified in the stack document:
   - React with TypeScript
   - Electron
   - Express
   - SQLite (using Prisma ORM)
   - Jest for testing
   - ESLint and Prettier for code quality
   - Material-UI for UI components

3. **Configuration Files**: Create and configure:
   - `package.json` with all necessary dependencies and scripts
   - `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration
   - `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc` for code style
   - `.gitignore` for excluding build artifacts and dependencies

4. **Basic Application Shell**: Create a minimal working application that:
   - Launches an Electron window
   - Loads a React application
   - Initializes an Express server in the Electron main process
   - Sets up a basic SQLite database connection

5. **Documentation**: Add a `README.md` with:
   - Project overview
   - Setup instructions
   - Available scripts
   - Project structure explanation

### Implementation Notes

- Follow the specified technology stack in `/architecture/stack.md`
- Set up TypeScript with strict mode for better type safety
- Configure ESLint and Prettier according to best practices
- Ensure proper separation of concerns between main process, renderer, and server
- Set up development scripts for easy local development
- The SQLite database should be configured to store in the user's app data directory
- Implement a minimal logging system
