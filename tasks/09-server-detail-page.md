# Task 09: Server Detail Page Implementation

## Task Context

**What this task does**: Implement the Server Detail page that displays comprehensive information about a specific MCP server, including metadata, reputation details, and user feedback.

**Why it's important**: The Server Detail page is critical for users to evaluate a specific MCP server before deciding whether to use it. It needs to present all relevant information in a clear, organized manner and allow users to provide feedback.

- [UI Components](/design/components.md)
- [Design System](/design/system.md)
- [Notes for Developers](/design/notes-for-devs.md)

## Instructions

Implement the Server Detail page according to the design specifications, utilizing the UI components created in previous tasks and integrating with backend services to display server data and handle user feedback.

### Deliverables

1. **Server Detail Component**: Create the main server detail component with:
   - Server overview section (name, logo, reputation score, metadata)
   - Tabbed interface for different content sections
   - Action buttons for external links
   - Related servers section

2. **Tabbed Content Sections**: Implement the following tabs:
   - Description tab with full server details
   - Reputation Details tab showing score breakdown
   - Feedback tab with user feedback and submission form
   - Usage Information tab with installation and configuration details

3. **Server Data Integration**: Connect to backend services to retrieve:
   - Comprehensive server metadata
   - Reputation score details
   - User feedback
   - Related servers

4. **Feedback Submission**: Implement feedback submission functionality:
   - Create feedback submission form
   - Validate user inputs
   - Submit to backend API
   - Show success/error states
   - Update feedback list after submission

5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the detail page works well on different screen sizes:
   - Desktop layout with side-by-side sections
   - Tablet layout with adjusted proportions
   - Mobile layout with stacked sections

6. **State Management**: Implement proper state handling for:
   - Loading states
   - Error states
   - Tab switching
   - Feedback submission
   - Dynamic content updates

- Implement proper navigation to those server pages

### API Integration

Integrate with the following API endpoints:

1. **Server Details Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/servers/:id` - Retrieve comprehensive server details

2. **Server Reputation Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/servers/:id/reputation` - Get detailed reputation score data

3. **Server Feedback Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/servers/:id/feedback` - Retrieve user feedback
   - `POST /api/servers/:id/feedback` - Submit new feedback

4. **Related Servers Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/servers/:id/related` - Get list of related servers

### Implementation Notes

- Implement deep linking to specific tabs via URL parameters
- Use proper semantic HTML for better accessibility
- Ensure all external links open in new tabs with proper security attributes
- Handle long text and descriptions gracefully
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Optimize images and assets for performance
- Consider implementing data prefetching for related servers
- Use appropriate transition animations for tab switching
- Ensure keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- Implement proper loading indicators for async operations
