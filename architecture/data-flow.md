# MCP Registry - Data Flow

This document outlines how data flows through the MCP Registry system, from external sources to the user interface.

## Core Data Flows

### 1. Data Collection Flow

```
External Sources → Data Collection Service → Database → Reputation Scoring Engine
```

**Process Description**:
1. The Scheduler triggers data collection at configured intervals (daily) [Manually added: in first init, the db will be still empty, so triggering the first collection in this step is a must]
2. Source Adapters connect to external sources (GitHub API, Glama.ai, etc.)
3. Raw data is fetched and passed to the Data Normalization module
4. Normalized data is validated for completeness and correctness
5. Valid data is stored in the database, replacing or updating existing records
6. The Reputation Scoring Engine is notified of new or updated data
7. Collection metrics and errors are logged for monitoring

**Key Considerations**:
- Handle API rate limits gracefully (especially for GitHub)
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Track last successful collection time per source
- Maintain data integrity during partial collection failures

### 2. Reputation Scoring Flow

```
Database → Reputation Scoring Engine → Database
```

**Process Description**:
1. The Scoring Engine receives notifications of new/updated server data
2. Server data is retrieved from the database
3. Factor Analyzers process specific aspects (GitHub metrics, maintenance frequency, etc.)
4. The Score Calculator combines factor scores using a weighted algorithm
5. Generated reputation scores are stored in the database
6. Historical scores are updated for trend tracking
7. Scoring metrics are logged for algorithm refinement

**Key Considerations**:
- Design the scoring algorithm to be configurable and extensible
- Maintain score history for trend analysis
- Consider batch processing for efficiency during large data updates

### 3. Search and Discovery Flow

```
User Interface → API Layer → Search Service → Database → API Layer → User Interface
```

**Process Description**:
1. User inputs search criteria in the Web Interface
2. Search request is sent to the API Layer
3. The Search Service processes the query, applying filters and sorting parameters
4. Optimized database queries retrieve matching server records
5. Results are formatted and paginated as needed
6. The API Layer returns structured results to the Web Interface
7. The Web Interface renders the results for the user

**Key Considerations**:
- Optimize queries for performance, especially for text search
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Consider caching frequent searches
- Provide clear error handling for failed searches

### 4. User Contribution Flow

```
User Interface → API Layer → Contribution Service → Database
```

**Process Description**:
1. User submits a new server or feedback through the Web Interface
2. Submission is sent to the API Layer
3. The Contribution Service validates the submission
4. Valid submissions are stored in the database
5. For new server submissions, the Data Collection Service is triggered to fetch additional metadata
6. The Reputation Scoring Engine may update scores based on new feedback

**Key Considerations**:
- Validate submission completeness and correctness

### 5. Server Detail View Flow

```
User Interface → API Layer → Database → API Layer → User Interface
```

**Process Description**:
1. User selects a server from search results or directory
2. Server ID is sent to the API Layer
3. Comprehensive server data is retrieved from the database
4. The API Layer formats the data for presentation
5. The Web Interface renders the detailed server view
6. User interactions (e.g., feedback submission) trigger additional data flows

**Key Considerations**:
- Optimize for complete data retrieval in a single query
- Include reputation score breakdown and history
- Load user contributions and feedback
- Consider caching frequently accessed server details

## Notes for Dev Team Lead

- **Implementation Priorities**:
  - Focus first on implementing the Data Collection Flow as it's the foundation
  - Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout all flows
  - Design clear API contracts between components

- **Complexity Assessment**:
  - The Data Collection Flow has the highest complexity due to external dependencies
  - The Reputation Scoring Flow requires careful algorithm design for extensibility
  - The Search Flow needs optimization for performance as the database grows

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Implement appropriate indexes in the database
  - Use batching for bulk operations in the Data Collection Flow
  - Create pagination defaults that balance usability and performance

- **Monitoring Recommendations**:
  - Log all external API calls and their outcomes
  - Track database query performance
  - Monitor reputation score distribution for algorithm validation
  - Implement basic telemetry for user search patterns
