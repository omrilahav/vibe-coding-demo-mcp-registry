# MCP Registry - Architecture Overview

## System Purpose

MCP Registry is a web-based application that serves as a centralized directory for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The system aggregates data from multiple sources, calculates reputation scores, and provides a searchable interface for users to discover and evaluate MCP servers.

## High-Level Architecture

The MCP Registry follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Components Overview

1. **Data Collection Service**
   - Responsible for aggregating MCP server data from external sources
   - Implements adapters for each data source (Glama.ai, GitHub, etc.)
   - Schedules periodic data refresh (daily)
   - Validates and normalizes incoming data

2. **Core Application Service**
   - Houses the business logic including the reputation scoring algorithm
   - Manages server metadata and user contributions
   - Handles search, filtering, and sorting operations
   - Processes user submissions and feedback

3. **Web Interface**
   - Provides the user-facing frontend application
   - Implements responsive design for various devices
   - Delivers interactive search and discovery experience
   - Displays server details and reputation metrics

4. **Database**
   - Stores all MCP server metadata
   - Maintains user contributions and feedback
   - Tracks historical data for trend analysis
   - Supports efficient querying for search operations

5. **API Layer**
   - Enables communication between frontend and backend
   - Provides structured endpoints for all operations
   - Implements rate limiting and security controls
   - Supports future external API access

## MVP Implementation Considerations

For the initial MVP:

1. The application will begin as a local application (not yet deployed as a web service)
2. Data collection will focus on the two main sources mentioned in the PRD (Glama.ai and GitHub)
3. The reputation scoring algorithm will use basic metrics (GitHub activity, maintenance frequency, open-source status)
4. User contributions will be stored locally without requiring user accounts
5. The system will check for data freshness (last update > 1 day) to trigger re-scanning

## Notes for Dev Team Lead

- **Implementation Priority**: Start with the data collection service as it forms the foundation of the application
- **Complexity Management**: Keep the initial reputation scoring algorithm simple but design it to be extensible
- **Tradeoffs**: For MVP, favor development speed and data completeness over advanced features
- **Technical Challenges**: Data normalization across different sources will require careful handling
- **Scalability Considerations**: Design the database schema to accommodate growth in both server entries and metadata fields
- **Testing Approach**: Implement comprehensive testing for the data collection service as it's critical for system reliability
