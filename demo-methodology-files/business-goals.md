ðŸ“Œ Business Goal for Prompt 1: Product Manager

We aim to build a simple, web-based application that aggregates publicly available Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into a centralized, searchable directory. The application will continuously scan known sources to collect MCP server metadata, such as name, description, license, GitHub stars, and recent activity. Each server will be evaluated using a basic reputation score based on factors like open-source status, popularity, and maintenance frequency.

The goal is to provide developers and researchers with an easy-to-use interface to discover, assess, and monitor MCP servers, especially in light of recent security concerns like tool poisoning and prompt injection attacks . The MVP should focus on core functionalities: data aggregation, reputation scoring, and a user-friendly UI for browsing and searching.

Example data sources: 
	â€¢	Glamaâ€™s MCP Tools Directory: https://glama.ai/mcp/tools
	â€¢	Awesome MCP Servers: https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers 
	â€¢	Model Context Protocol Servers: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers  

For each MCP server, the application should collect metadata, for example:
	â€¢	Server name and description
	â€¢	License type (e.g., open-source, proprietary)
	â€¢	GitHub statistics (stars, forks, recent activity)
	â€¢	Number of downloads or usage metrics, if available
	â€¢	Community feedback or reviews

A basic reputation score should be calculated for each server based on factors like open-source status, popularity, maintenance frequency, and community feedback.

Key Requirements:
	â€¢	Simplicity: Focus on core functionalities to keep the MVP straightforward and user-friendly.
	â€¢	Visual Appeal: Design a clean and intuitive UI that effectively presents the aggregated data and reputation scores.
	â€¢	Storage: Implement a database to store MCP server records, enabling sorting, filtering, and future scalability.
	â€¢	User Interaction: Allow users to submit new MCP servers for inclusion and provide feedback or reviews on existing entries. ï¿¼

Purpose:

This tool is intended to assist developers and researchers in discovering and evaluating MCP servers, especially in light of recent security concerns such as tool poisoning and prompt injection attacks. By providing a centralized repository with reputation scores and community feedback, users can make informed decisions about integrating MCP servers into their workflows.
